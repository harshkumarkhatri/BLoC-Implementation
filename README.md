## Introduction 📌

BLoC is one of things which can help us manage the state of the app in best way possible.

I have tried implementing BLoC architecture in the default counter app and in the News app fetching data from the api.

## Technology Stack 🏁

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)
- [Intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl)

## Why this Project? 🏃‍♂️

My main goal behind creating this project was to learn how i can implement BLoC in a flutter project without actually using BLoC package

The code for the counter app is commented and can be used by changing the main screen in the main.dart file and uncommenting the code.

For this project, i have worked on various domains like:
* State management with BLoC
* Data fetching from an API
* Ui for news page
